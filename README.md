FoldLeft2-and-ack-in-scala
==========================

Two functions we were asked to implement on our PL final at CU:

1. foldLeft2
2. ack

These are my solutions. They seem to work, but if you can improve them
just submit a pull request.

Shout out to Prof. Baker and Dana for teaching me some scala this semester!
